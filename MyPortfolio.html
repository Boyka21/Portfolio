<h1> Anthony Garcia</h1>
<h2> Upcoming Software Developer</h2>
<hr>
<p> My <i>Favorite</i> thing about programming is the challenging aspect of the learning environments that it contains along with the endless amount of knowledge that is able to be attained as long as the effort is put into it!</p>

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Privet! My name is Anthony, and I have an extremely strange history in life! Throughout my years I have always been an
introverted, keep-to-myself individual. As my confidence built up over time before I became an adult, my life changed
drastically, and weirdly as well.
I went from being overweight at the age of 19, to being a stripper at the age of 21.
I also was a professional gamer for a few years before the change. I've also trained in many different forms of Martial
Arts throughout my life but took it more seriously after my prioritization in life has changed.
I have also done some voice acting recreationally and auditioned for a few roles, even repeats. Fun, but very
competitive!
